# Cave Dust

## What...what is "Cave Dust"?

I'm glad you asked! It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust! After all, the air wouldn't be 100% clear in a real mineshaft :p

Now to the nitty gritty:
It works by checking if the player has the sky above them while being below sea level and then scales the amount of particles based on depth.
<br><br>It has a config system that you can access using Mod Menu.

## Dependencies
Cave Dust requires the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) but everything else Cave Dust *needs* is included.
***HOWEVER***, I recommend [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) to be able to use the config screen :p
