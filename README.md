# Dust

## What...what is "Dust"?

I'm glad you asked! It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust! After all, the air wouldn't be 100% clear in a real mineshaft :p

Now to the nitty gritty:
It works by checking if the player has the sky above them and by scaling the amount of particles based on depth.

-64y lots of particles!

64y: less particles :(

## Dependencies

Dust has everything it *needs* but I recommend [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) to be able to use the config screen :p
